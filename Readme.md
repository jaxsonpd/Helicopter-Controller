## ENCE361 Helicopter Control Project

Created by: Jack Duignan (Jdu80@uclive.ac.nz), Daniel Hawes (dha144@uclive.ac.nz)

This project aims to control a remote controlled helicopter using the Tiva microprocessor. This project is writen in raw C with the Tiva API. The helicopter is capabiable of taking off rotating left and right and moving up and down. The both rotors are controlled by a custom PID loop and the program runs on a forground/background kernel with a round robin Schedular. This project is designed to be run in Code Composer Studio on a Tiva microprocessor. Please ensure that the orbitOLED folder is in the parent folder to the repository.
